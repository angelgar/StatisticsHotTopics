## Motivation
The goal of our analysis is to understand the evolution of statistics over time, specifically in regards to "hot topics" used in research. We analyzed the titles of articles published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA) since 1888, as well as other factors such as authors, number of citations, etc. We used data gathered to create exploratory plots regarding the aforementioned factors. Specifically, we then found correlations of specific "hot topics" with article impact as measured by article views and citations.

## Initial questions
The main question of interest is to undertand if/how keywords used in the titles of JASA-published papers have evolved over time, and when certain topcs arose 

What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

## Data

## Additional analysis
If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail

## Discussion
What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?
